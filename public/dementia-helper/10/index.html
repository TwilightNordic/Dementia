        <p>Physical activity is a cornerstone of dementia care, offering profound benefits for physical health, cognitive function, emotional well-being, and overall quality of life. For people living with dementia, regular movement and exercise can help maintain independence, reduce symptoms, and foster social connection. This comprehensive guide explores the science behind physical activity, a wide range of exercises, caregiver strategies, and real-world examples to help families and professionals support safe and enjoyable movement at every stage of dementia.</p>

<p>Numerous studies have demonstrated the benefits of regular exercise for people with dementia.
