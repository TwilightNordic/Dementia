      <description>&lt;p&gt;Caregivers are the unsung backbone of dementia care. The role is deeply meaningful but can also be physically exhausting, emotionally draining, and socially isolating. Supporting caregivers means preserving the health of both the caregiver and the person receiving care. This expanded guide takes a close look at practical self-care techniques, system-level supports, community resources, and strategies to maintain resilience over the long haul.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-many-faces-of-caregiver-stress&#34;&gt;The many faces of caregiver stress&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Caregiving stress shows up in many forms—chronic fatigue, disrupted sleep, anxiety, depression, and worsening chronic medical conditions. Caregivers often feel constant worry about safety, finances, and future planning. Social withdrawal is common as time and energy shrink, and the role can strain personal relationships and employment.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
